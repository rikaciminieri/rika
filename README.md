# 🌸 Rika's Corner of the Internet ✨

Hi! Welcome to my little corner where code meets creativity and science nerds become tech advocates! 🧬→💻

## 🎯 What's This All About?

This is my personal website built with React and sprinkled with lots of personality! It features:

- 🌓 A snazzy dark mode for my fellow night owls
- 🗣️ Bilingual support (English/日本語) because why not?
- 👩🏻‍💻 A peek into who I am and what I do
- 🤝 Ways to connect with me

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- React
- TailwindCSS
- A dash of animation magic ✨
- Lots of love and probably too many emojis 💝
